This repository contains my project for the [MPRI 2.39 Graphics and Visualization](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=cours:c-2-39) course.

The code here provides a sort of simulation of the [Sinai billiard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_billiards). The main difference is that in the case of the Sinai billiard, we only have two particles interacting; here, the user can pick any number of particles.
